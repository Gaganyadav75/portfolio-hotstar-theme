# 🚀 Gagan Yadav — Portfolio

This is a modern portfolio website built with [**Next.js 15**](https://nextjs.org), bootstrapped using [\`create-next-app\`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).  
It showcases my work, skills, and personality — all wrapped in a fast, responsive, and developer-friendly design.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

First, run the development server:

\`\`\`

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see your app live.  
The page updates automatically as you edit files — no need to reload manually.
